	<h2> Measuring Epson V550 Scanner MTF </h2>

	<h3> Background </h3>

<p> I have an Epson V550 perfection for scanning film which is <i>barely</i> adequate. It's just not
sharp, noisy, and doesn't offer me the control I want. So I thought it would be fun to measure its
modulation transfer function (MTF) and point spread function (PSF). If you're unfamiliar with what
those are and how they're related, LenRentals has a <a
href="https://www.lensrentals.com/blog/2017/10/the-8k-conundrum-when-bad-lenses-mount-good-sensors/">
great explanation</a> with real world lens examples. If you find it interesting, I highly recommend
checking out the rest of their blog too. </p>

	<h3> Knife Edge MTF Measurement </h3>

<p> As mentioned in the LensRentals blog post, the MTF curve is just the Fourier transform of the
PSF. I'll be measuring the PSF and using it to calculate the MTF curve. You can also use the PSF to
model what image the scanner would produce, given a known, ideal input:

<blockquote>
	OUTPUT(x) = INPUT(x) &lowast; PSF(x) <br>
	<i>&emsp;Note: &lowast; is convolution</i>
</blockquote>

Convolving your input with the PSF gives you your output. This also means if we know the input and
output we can calculate the PSF. </p>

<p> Ideally, the input would be an ideal point source which is expressed mathematically as the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_delta_function">dirac delta function &delta;(x)</a>.
Convolving a function with &delta;(x) yields the same function (i.e. it is the identity transform),
so if the input is &delta;(x) then the output would be the PSF. Unfortunately, real world ideal
point sources are hard to come by. I could use a pinhole, but I'd need a way of measuring it's
diameter which is also hard. In order to calculate the PSF I need a known input and in two
dimensions that's just too hard. </a>

<p> So instead I'll just measure it in one dimension at a time. I still don't have an ideal point
source, but you can get an ideal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaviside_step_function">
step function</a>: a razorblade edge. The step function also has a handy property: it's derivative
is &delta;(x). Combining that knowledge with the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution#Differentiation"> derivative of two convolved
functions</a> we can derive the PSF from just the scanned image of a razorblade edge:

<blockquote>

OUTPUT(x) = STEP(x) &lowast; PSF(x) <br>

&emsp;<i>Take the derivative of both sides</i><br>

OUTPUT ' (x) = (STEP(x) &lowast; PSF(x)) ' <br>

&emsp;<i>Use the derivative of convolved functions to simplify the right hand side</i><br>

OUTPUT ' (x) = STEP ' (x) &lowast; PSF(x) <br>

&emsp;<i>Replace STEP'(x) with its derivative, &delta;(x)</i><br>

OUTPUT ' (x) = &delta;(x) &lowast; PSF(x) <br>

&emsp;<i>Convolving a function with &delta;(x) is the identify transform</i><br>

OUTPUT ' (x) = PSF(x)

</blockquote>

Remember: this is only in one dimension; I'll be taking an individual column or row of an image and
treating the data in that column/row as samples of the one dimensional OUTPUT(x) function.</p>

<p> So overall the procedure looks like this: <ol>

<li> Scan a razor blade aligned either horizontally or vertically </li>

<li> Crop the scan to just the edge </li>

<li> Pick a row or column that crosses that edge </li>

<li> Take the derivative of that data to yield the PSF </li>

<li> Take the Fourier transform of the PSF to yield the MTF </li>

</ol>

I've written a <a href="https://gist.github.com/ajeddeloh/07073bae201f0024e44295d8ecdb6600"> python
script</a> to load an image of just the edge, calculate the MTF curves for every row/column, and
plot them all. It's what I used to generate the graphs below.

	<h3> Are the horizontal and vertical resolution the same? </h3>

The razor blade would not fit in the Epson film holders, so I used a slide frame. There is a slight
difference in the height (1.0mm for the Epson, 0.9mm for the frame) but that turns out to not make
much difference. More on that later.

The graph is "fuzzy" because I graphed the MTF for all rows of pixels crossing over the razor blade
edge. Any dust, noise, etc can cause the fuzziness.

<img src=./horizontal_framed.png>

Looking at the two graphs, there doesn't seem to be much difference in either direction, so from now
on I'll just be running tests in the vertical direction.

	<h3> How does this differ from others results </h3>

<a href=https://www.filmscanner.info/en/EpsonPerfectionV600Photo.html>ScanDig</a> has also performed
resolution tests on the V600 (which is nearly identical to the V550). They found the resolution to
be different in the vertical and horizontal directions at about 25 lp/mm and 35 lp/mm (to convert
from ppi to lp/mm divide by 50.8). This corresponds to about an MTF of 20% and 10% on my scans,
which seems reasonable as a threshold for the smallest delta discernible. The discrepancy between
their results and mine could be due to model-to-model variance. Since they are not measuring MTF and
rely on human judgement our results are not directly comparable, but they appear to be in the same
ballpark.

	<h3> How much does height above the glass matter? </h3>

<p> People commonly claim that the V550 film holders do not place the film at the proper height and
that custom film holders can solve this problem. I put the razor blade in at an angle, resting on
the edge of the slide holder so the height of the edge varied over distance. This allows me to see
how the MTF changes with film height. </p>

<p> Then I graphed the MTF at three spatial resolutions (10, 20 and 30 lp/mm) vs the y coordinate
the 1d slice of data came from. The noise on the right side of the graph is from where the blade was
resting on the edge of the slide holder (4.2mm tall). I kept it in because it let me confirm which
end of the graph was (nearly) against the glass (left) and which was significantly above it (right).
</p>

<p> Height above the glass clearly has an effect on MTF, but the best position is about the same as
the height the razor blade sits at in the slide holder. I don't think there's much to be gained by
buying custom holders unless your film is curling/bowing up significantly. Then again, this could
vary unit to unit.</p>

	<h3> Does VueScan help? </h3>

<p> In a word: No. </p>

<p> VueScan offers the option to auto focus while the SANE API (Linux scanning API) does not report
capability. I wondered if it actually does anything. Initially I was thrown off because VueScan was
applying curves to the image. When doing MTF tests it's important to not do any <i>nonlinear</i>
processing on the image which includes applying curves. I didn't realize this at first and the
curves ended up increasing the MTF a bit. This led me down a wild goose chase with me eventually
confirming that the autofocus button does not change the commands sent to the scanner in any way.
I'll write a follow up to this post with the details later. After spending a couple days doing that
I stumbled on the "save raw" button and confirmed that the raw scans from VueScan are in fact no
sharper than using the SANE API.

	<h3> What's next? </h3>

<p> There are several things I still want to investigate: <ul>

<li> Color: Are some color channels sharper than others? Do they have different heights for optimal
focus due to longitudinal chromatic abberation? </li>

<li> Can I use the PSF to make a deconvolution kernel and get better looking images than the unsharp
mask filters in most image processing libraries? </li>

<li> How do these results compare to a test with a 1951 USAF resolution test chart (which I would
need to buy) </li>

</ul>
