	<h2> Measuring Epson V550 Scanner MTF </h2>

	<h3> Background </h3>

<p> I have an Epson V550 perfection for scanning film which is <i>barely</i> adequate. It's just not
sharp, it's noisy (sensor-wise), and it doesn't offer me the control I want. I thought it would be
fun to measure its modulation transfer function (MTF) and point spread function (PSF) to determine
just how soft it is. If you're unfamiliar with what those are and how they're related, LenRentals
has a <a
href="https://www.lensrentals.com/blog/2017/10/the-8k-conundrum-when-bad-lenses-mount-good-sensors/">
great explanation</a> with real world lens examples. If you find that interesting, I highly
recommend checking out the rest of their blog too. </p>

	<h3> Knife Edge MTF Measurement </h3>

<p> As mentioned in the LensRentals blog post, the MTF is just the Fourier transform of the PSF.
I'll be measuring the PSF and using it to calculate the MTF. You can also use the PSF to model what
image the scanner would produce, given a known, ideal input:

<blockquote>
	OUTPUT(x) = INPUT(x) &lowast; PSF(x) <br>
	<i>&emsp;Note: &lowast; is <a href="https://betterexplained.com/articles/intuitive-convolution/">convolution</a></i>
</blockquote>

Convolving your input with the PSF gives you your output. If we know the input and output we can
calculate the PSF. </p>

<p> Ideally, the input would be a perfect point source which is expressed as the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_delta_function">dirac delta function &delta;(x)</a>.
Convolving a function with &delta;(x) yields the same function (i.e. &delta;(x) &lowast; f(x) =
f(x)), so if INPUT(x) is a perfect point source &delta;(x) then the output would be the PSF.
Unfortunately, real world ideal point sources are hard to come by. I could use a pinhole, but I'd
need a way of measuring it's diameter which is also hard.</p>

<p> Instead I'll measure the PSF in one dimension at a time. I still don't have an ideal one
dimensional point source, but you can get an ideal <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaviside_step_function"> step function</a>: a razorblade edge.
The step function also has a handy property: it's derivative is &delta;(x). Combining that knowledge
with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution#Differentiation"> derivative of two
convolved functions</a> we can derive the PSF from just the scanned image of a razorblade edge:

<blockquote>

OUTPUT(x) = STEP(x) &lowast; PSF(x) <br>

&emsp;<i>Take the derivative of both sides</i><br>

OUTPUT ' (x) = (STEP(x) &lowast; PSF(x)) ' <br>

&emsp;<i>Use the derivative of convolved functions to simplify the right hand side</i><br>

OUTPUT ' (x) = STEP ' (x) &lowast; PSF(x) <br>

&emsp;<i>Replace STEP'(x) with its derivative, &delta;(x)</i><br>

OUTPUT ' (x) = &delta;(x) &lowast; PSF(x) <br>

&emsp;<i>Convolving a function with &delta;(x) is the identify transform</i><br>

OUTPUT ' (x) = PSF(x)

</blockquote>

Remember: this is only in one dimension; I'll be taking an individual column or row of an image and
treating the data in that column/row as samples of the one dimensional OUTPUT(x) function.</p>

<p> So overall the procedure looks like this: <ol>

<li> Scan a razor blade aligned either horizontally or vertically </li>

<li> Crop the scan to just the edge </li>

<li> Pick a row or column that crosses that edge </li>

<li> Take the derivative of that data to yield the PSF </li>

<li> Take the Fourier transform of the PSF to yield the MTF </li>

</ol>

I've written a <a href="https://gist.github.com/ajeddeloh/07073bae201f0024e44295d8ecdb6600"> python
script</a> to load an image of just the edge, calculate the MTF curves for every row/column, and
plot them all. It's what I used to generate the graphs below.

	<h3> Are the horizontal and vertical resolution the same? </h3> 

<b> Update 12/21: </b> <i> I ran the horizontal test again and got different results. I think the
originally published results were taken with a gamma curve applied. This post has been edited to
reflect the new data. </i>

<p> The razor blade would not fit in the Epson film holders, so I used a slide frame. There is a
slight difference in the height (1.0mm for the Epson, 0.9mm for the frame) but that turns out to not
make much difference. More on that later. </p>

<center>Vertical edge, in slide frame, 0.9mm above glass</center>

<p> The graph is fuzzy because I plotted the MTF for all rows of pixels crossing over the razor
blade edge on the same graph. Any dust, noise, or nicks in the razor blade can cause fuzziness. </p>

<center>Horizontal edge, in slide frame, 0.9mm above glass</center>

Looking at the two graphs, the scanner is sharper measuring a vertical edge. This means scans of
landscape photos will be sharper vertically than horizontally. In practice, I don't notice this in
actual scans of film, but if you were scanning film shot with an anamorphic lens, it might be a good
idea to mount them in slide frames and rotate them. I wonder if this is in part due to the sensor
bar moving and vibration causing blurriness.

	<h3> How does this differ from others results </h3>

<b> Update 12/21: </b> <i> This has been updated with the new data described above </i>

<p> <a href=https://www.filmscanner.info/en/EpsonPerfectionV600Photo.html>ScanDig</a> has also
performed resolution tests on the V600 (which is nearly identical to the V550). They also found the
resolution to be different in the vertical and horizontal directions at about 25 lp/mm and 35 lp/mm
(to convert from their PPI to lp/mm divide by 50.8). Their test methodology is different from mine.
Instead of measuring the full MTF they determine the resolution they can no longer discern the
difference between black and white bars in a test target. </p>

<p> Their measurements correspond to an MTF of ~5% on both of my graphs. This seems reasonable as a
threshold for the smallest discernible contrast. Since they are not measuring a full MTF curve and
rely on human judgement to determine the resolution, our results are not directly comparable, but
they are in the same ballpark. </p>

	<h3> How much does height above the glass matter? </h3>

<p> People commonly claim that the V550 film holders do not place the film at the proper height and
that custom film holders can solve this problem. I put the razor blade in at an angle, resting on
the edge of the slide holder so the height of the edge varied over distance. This allows me to see
how the MTF changes with film height. </p>

<center> Slanted test setup </center>
<img src="./slant_setup.jpg">

<p> Then I graphed the MTF at three spatial resolutions (10, 20 and 30 lp/mm) vs the y coordinate
the 1d slice of data came from. The noise on the right side of the graph is from where the blade was
resting on the edge of the slide holder (4.2mm tall). I kept it in because it let me confirm which
end of the graph was (nearly) against the glass (left) and which was significantly above it (right).
</p>

<center> MTF at 10, 20, and 30 lp/mm. Left side of graph is on glass </center>
<img src="./slant.png">

<p> Height above the glass clearly has an effect on MTF, but the best position is about the same as
the height the razor blade sits at in the slide holder. I don't think there's much to be gained by
buying custom holders unless your film is curling/bowing up significantly. Then again, this could
vary unit to unit.</p>

<b> Update 12/21: </b><i>This subsection was added</i>
<br><br>

<center> MTF at 10, 20, and 30 lp/mm. Right side of graph is on glass </center>
<img src="./h_slant.png">

<p> Testing with the razorblade running horizontally at a slant produced similar results; the area
of best focus near but not on the glass. The MTF was lower across the board which also matches the
MTF curve above where the horizontal edge is not as sharp as the vertical edge.</p>

<h3> Does VueScan help? </h3>

<p> In a word: No. </p>

<p> VueScan offers the option to auto focus while the SANE API (Linux scanning API) does not report
capability. I wondered if it actually does anything. Initially I was thrown off because VueScan was
applying curves to the image. When doing MTF tests it's important to not do any <i>nonlinear</i>
processing on the image which includes applying curves. I didn't realize this at first and the
curves ended up increasing the MTF a bit. This led me down a wild goose chase with me eventually
confirming that the autofocus button does not change the commands sent to the scanner in any way.
I'll write a follow up to this post with the details later. After spending a couple days doing that
I stumbled on the "save raw" button and confirmed that the raw scans from VueScan are in fact no
sharper than using the SANE API.

	<h3> What's next? </h3>

<p> There are several things I still want to investigate: <ul>

<li> Color: Are some color channels sharper than others? Do they have different heights for optimal
focus due to longitudinal chromatic abberation? </li>

<li> Can I use the PSF to make a deconvolution kernel and get better looking images than the unsharp
mask filters in most image processing libraries? </li>

<li> How do these results compare to a test with a 1951 USAF resolution test chart (which I would
need to buy) </li>

</ul>
