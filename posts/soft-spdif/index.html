	<h3> Background </h3>

<p> Last time I moved, I set up my <a href="../fixing-sx525"> receiver</a> and speakers across the
room from my desk and computer. It's a pretty long (~20 feet) cable run. I was worried the audio
quality would degrade over that distance, especially over my cheap cables. While that didn't end up
being a issue, I considered a lot of possible solutions, like using differential signals, Bluetooth,
PulseAudio, or S/PDIF. While I have no need for a S/PDIF decoder since the analog signal works just
fine, the idea stuck rattled around in my head for a while. My STM32L476 Discovery board has an
I<sup>2</sup>S DAC on it, but no hardware S/PDIF decoder, so I figured it would be fun to write a
S/PDIF to I<sup>2</sup>S converter. </p>

	<h3> S/PDIF Primer </h3>

<i>Note: S/PDIF supports many audio formats. This only talks about 16 bit raw PCM mode.</i>

<p> S/PDIF uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_Manchester_encoding">biphase
mark encoding</a> to create a self clocking signal. S/PDIF sends its data in frames, each of which
is made of two subframes. Each subframe is a sample for a channel. Each subframe starts with a
synchronization pattern (which is not biphase mark encoded) which denotes both the start of frame as
well as a which channel it is. STM has an <a

note</a> on using their higher end microcontrollers to decode S/PDIF using a built in hardware
peripheral, but it also includes information on the protocol itself, if you want to learn more.</p>

<p> To decode S/PDIF there are a few basic steps:

<ol> <li> Recover the clock so you can read the incoming data </li>

<li> Find the start of the frame and synchronize the stream so you can read frames </li>

<li> Read in the data </li>

<li> Decode the biphase mark encoding and extract the data </li></ol>

S/PDIF also sends metadata about the signal, its source, etc, but in my case I didn't care so I
ignored it.

	<h3> Things Which Didn't Work and Other Challenges</h3>

	<h4> Finding a S/PDIF source </h4>

<p> The first problem was finding a S/PDIF source. My old desktop has an TOSLINK (optical) port but
no coax and I'd prefer to not have to make/buy a converter. Luckily I have a spare Raspberry Pi 4
and there's <a href=https://github.com/mill1000/raS/PDIF>a project</a> to send raw PCM data out as
S/PDIF. I ran into a few <a href="https://github.com/mill1000/raS/PDIF/issues/10">issues</a> getting
it to work on a Pi 4 but once I fixed them it worked great. </p>

	<h4> Using the DFDSM for clock recover </h4>

<p> The STM32L476 does not have a hardware S/PDIF decoder, nor does it have a clock recovery
peripheral. However, it does have "Digital Filter for Delta Sigma Modulators" peripheral that can
recover the clock from manchester encoded data streams. My initial plan was to use that for clock
recovery and connect the CKOUT signal on the PC2 pin to the SPI clock input and read the data in as
SPI. Unfortunately, that pin isn't broken out on the header on my the development board and is
instead hooked up to a magnometer. I didn't want to bodge-solder on a lead to the pin so that plan
was out. I'm also not sure if a recovered clock signal is output onto CKOUT when doing clock
recovery. It may only be used when the STM is generating the clock signal itself. The reference
manual is unclear. </p>

	<h4> Using DMA with bit banding to update timer configuration </h4>
	
<p> My next idea was to use timers triggered on the rising edge of the S/PDIF signal to generate the
SPI clock and I<sup>2</sup>S MCLK. However, since the MCLK frequency isn't a nice multiple of my
80MHz core clock, they need to be synced _very_ frequently. For 48kHz audio the MCLK frequency is
about 12MHz, which means a period of 6.5 cycles. Since there are potentially 8 MCLK cycles between
rising edges of the S/PDIF signal that means 4 cycles of drift since the period must be an integer.
Given the time between transitions is only 3 cycles, that's a problem. </p>

<p> So I tried to see if I could sync every edge, whether it's rising or falling. Unfortunately, the
timers don't support this: you can sync on a rising edge or a falling edge (controlled by the
<code>ETP</code> bit in the <code>SMCR</code> register) but not both. My idea for solving this was
to use DMA to toggle the state of that bit by copying the bit from GPIO to the <code>SMCR</code>
register using bit banding. </p>

<p> The first problem is that the GPIO peripheral's memory mapped registers are outside the bit
banding memory range. This was okay, however since the pin I was using was PE8, which means the data
is in the LSB of the second byte of the <code>GPIOE-&gt;IDR</code> register. I could just use that
byte as the DMA source.</p>

<p> The second problem is that <i>you can't use DMA and bit banding together</i>. Bit Banding is
handled by the core and thus not available to peripherals like DMA. How unfortunate. This was pretty
much the death knell of the sync-every-edge idea. </p>

<p> In the end I just ran it at 44.1kHz which divides more evenly. I still need to sync the timers
but don't need to do it every edge. </p>

	<h4> Pulsing NSS to sync the stream </h4>

<p> Once I had clock recovery working (again, more on that later), I could read the S/PDIF data
stream in using the SPI peripheral. The next step is syncing the SPI stream so it starts capturing
the data at the start of the frame. By finding the synchronization sequence in the captured data I
can calculate how many S/PDIF clock cycles the receiver is off by then pause the SPI for that many
cycles to get it synced. I planned to use a timer to generate a pulse and connect it to the SPI NSS
pin. Sadly, if you disable the NSS line it does not pause the current SPI capture; it aborts it.
Then when NSS is active again it starts a new capture. This would work great if I could be certain I
was pausing it at a given time (i.e. at the end of an SPI capture), but with a clock period of 14
clock cycles I don't have that luxury. I need to be able to pause mid capture and resume like
nothing happened. </p>

<p> I ended up disabling the SPI clock during the pulse instead, but more on that in the next
section. </p>

	<h4> Giving up on I<sup>2</sup>S generation </h4>

<p>My development board has an I<sup>2</sup>S DAC attached to the <code>SAI1</code> peripheral,
which I was hoping to use. However in order to stay in sync with the S/PDIF stream I need to generate
the MCLK signal based on the clock recovered from the S/PDIF stream. The <code>SAI1</code> peripheral
allows for this but only on pin <code>PA0</code> which is needed for the timers (more on that
later). There wasn't any way to get around that so I gave up on generating audio and decided to just
decode the S/PDIF and call it a day.</p>

	<h3> Solution </h3>

	<h4> SPI SCLK Generation </h4>

<p> To generate the clock I use several timers. They have a two main jobs: generating the SPI clock
and pausing it for a precise length of time to sync the frames. Originally they also needed to
generate the MCLK signal for the I<sup>2</sup>S DAC, but that part was abandoned. Below is a diagram
showing how all the timers are connected. </p>

<img src="diagram.png"> <div style="text-align: right"><i>Timer configuration</i></div>

<p> Most of how the design is dictated by what GPIO pins I had available and how the timers are
connected internally. There are only two timers with external GPIO triggers (TIM8 and TIM2) and
TIM8's only available output channel is on the same pin as the TIM2 external trigger. I ended up
using TIM8 to generate an internal MCLK signal synced to the S/PDIF stream, then TIM5 to relay its
output to a GPIO pin. </p>

<p> To recover the clock, TIM8 is set up in external trigger and reset mode. It generates PWM on
channel 1 with the appropriate period and duty cycle for the recovered clock signal. The external
trigger is connected to the S/PDIF signal, which ensures every rising edge of the S/PDIF signal it
gets synced. Since the microcontroller clock and S/PDIF clock are independent of each other and not
even multiples of each other this generates a lot of jitter, but that's fine for just decoding.</p>

<img src="jitter.png"> <div style="text-align: right"><i>Not exactly low jitter</i></div>

<p> To generate the SPI clock in sync with the S/PDIF source and in a way that can be paused, TIM2
operates in gated + external clock mode and divides its external clock by 2. In this mode the
external clock must be from GPIO, so a jumper connects the output of TIM5 to the external trigger of
TIM2. The internal trigger is the gate and controls if the timer is active or not. It is connected
to TIM4 which generates the pulse to pause it. Its output is the SPI clock and connected to the SPI
peripheral via a jumper. <p>

<p> TIM4 uses the internal MCLK signal from TIM8 and generates the frame sync pulses. Once the first
frame is captured, the software determines the offset and configures TIM4 to generate a pulse which
pauses TIM2 (and thus the SPI clock) long enough to be start up again in sync. </p>

	<h4> Biphase Mark Decoding </h4>

<p> Biphase mark is easy enough to decode. You simply take your data, XOR it with a copy bit shifted
by one, then read the data you want off of every other bit. There are some fancier ways to do this
using more complicated bitwise math, but the naive approach was fast enough so I didn't bother. </p>

	<h3> Results </h3>

<p> The project decodes S/PDIF just fine. It would have been nice to get it actually using the DAC
but at this point I'm tired of this project and want to work on other things. I tested by running

<pre><code>[root@pi ~]# yes $'\xad\xde\xef\xbe' | tr -d '\n' | ./raspdif</code></pre>

and using the debugger to verifying it was in fact correctly decoding <code>0xdeadbeef</code>. Note
the data in the argument to <code>yes</code> is byte swapped since raspidif expects little endian
data. </p>
