	<h2> VueScan's Autofocus is Nonfunctional </h2>

	<h3> Background </h3>

<p> In my <a href=../scanner-mtf>previous post</a> I mentioned that while VueScan has the option to
use manual or automatic focus, it doesn't actually change how the scanner operates. This post is
proof that it doesn't do anything. To be clear, as far as I can tell, the v550 does not support
changing focus at all. This is not a shortcoming of VueScan, aside from presenting an option when it
shouldn't.</p>

<p> VueScan has a drop down for autofocus with the options of "Always", "Scan", "Preview" and
"Manual". Selecting "Manual" adds a slider that can be used to set the focus from -1.0 to 1.0. For
my tests I compared the commands sent to the scanner with it set to "Always" and "Manual" at both
-1.0 and 1.0. </p>

	<h3> The Epson v550 and Linux </h3>

<p> Epson's v550 scanner driver is split into an open source part (named epkowa) and a v550 specific
proprietary plugin. Both of these are installed as shared libraries at
<code>/usr/lib/sane/libsane-epkowa.so</code> and
<code>/usr/lib/iscan/libiscan-plugin-perfection-v550.so</code>, respectively. After digging around a
while I discovered that the open source driver communicates to the scanner in a protocol called
ESC/I which doesn't seem to be documented anywhere. Some <a
href=https://files.support.epson.com/pdf/per16u/per16upg.pdf>manuals</a> make reference to it
though. The v550 does not implement ESC/I directly, so the proprietary plugin interprets the ESC/I
and converts it to the scanner's native protocol. This is why it's referred to as an interpreter in
the <code>/usr/var/lib/iscan/interpreter</code> config file.</p>

	<h3> What is VueScan using? </h3>

<p> Running

<blockquote><code>$ strace -P /usr/lib/sane/libsane-epkowa.so ./vuescan</code></blockquote>

and

<blockquote><code>$ strace -P /usr/lib/iscan/libiscan-plugin-perfection-v550.so
./vuescan</code></blockquote>

shows that while VueScan does not use the open source <a href=https://sane-project.org>SANE</a>
interface, it does use the proprietary plugin. Fortunately, since the main epkowa driver is open
source, the API for that plugin is <a
href=https://github.com/ajeddeloh/iscan/blob/v2_30_4_2/backend/epkowa_ip_api.h>documented</a>. This
means I can create a shim that intercepts and logs calls to the shared library (see more details <a
href=https://rafalcieslak.wordpress.com/2013/04/02/dynamic-linker-tricks-using-ld_preload-to-cheat-inject-features-and-investigate-programs/>here</a>).
</p>

<p> You can find the source for my shim <a href=https://github.com/ajeddeloh/v550_wrapper>here</a>.
It's pretty simple and just logs everything being sent to/from the scanner to stderr with a R or W
prefix to indicate reads/writes. <p>

	<h3> Results </h3>

<i> Full logs (except for image data) are available <a
href=https://github.com/ajeddeloh/v550_wrapper/tree/master/results>here</a> </i>

<p> I ran VueScan both in normal scanning mode and in preview mode collecting logs scanning with
autofocus, with manual focus at the minimum, and with manual focus at the maximum. The first thing
that's clear is that there is no difference between the minimum and maximum focus: </p>

<blockquote><code>
	$ diff close_focus.log far_focus.log &amp;&amp; echo Same<br>
	&gt; Same
</code></blockquote>

<p> There is a slight difference between autofocus and the manual focus: </p>

<blockquote><code>
	$ diff close_focus.log auto_focus.log <br>
	&gt; W: 1b 65<br>
	&gt; R: 6<br>
	&gt; W: 1<br>
	&gt; R: 6<br>
</code></blockquote>

<p> The first line is ESC-e which is the command to <a
href=https://github.com/ajeddeloh/iscan/blob/v2_30_4_2/backend/command.c#L602 >control an
extension</a>. Extensions refer to extra parts like automatic document feeds or the transparency
scanning unit. It then reads back 6, writes 1 and reads another 6. I'm not sure what the one ands
sixes mean, but the open source driver call this function when <a
href=https://github.com/ajeddeloh/iscan/blob/v2_30_4_2/backend/epkowa.c#L1392>enabling an
extension</a>. My <i>guess</i> as to what's happening is VueScan has a common code path for turning
on autofocus that starts by enabling the transparency unit then does something device specific
(which is nothing for this scanner). But that's just a guess; I have no data to back that up. In any
case, it isn't doing anything to change how the scanner focuses. </p>

	<h3> Why not use LD_PRELOAD? Or ltrace? </h3>

<p> I tried but neither works in this case. Since VueScan is loading the shared library directly
from it's absolute path with <code>dlopen()</code>, LD_PRELOAD doesn't have any effect. From
<code>man 3 dlopen</code>: </p>

<blockquote>If filename is NULL, then the returned handle is for the main program. If filename
contains a slash  ("/"), then it is interpreted as a (relative or absolute) pathname. Otherwise, the
dynamic linker searches for the object as follows (see ld.so(8) for further details)</blockquote>

<p> Since the path does have a slash, the dynamic linker does not search for the object and thus
<code>LD_PRELOAD</code> is not used </p>

<p> I tried using <code>ltrace</code> but could not get it to work. Perhaps it has issues with
<code>dlopen</code> as well?</p>

	<h3> Final Thoughts </h3>

It's still possible that VueScan communicates with the scanner directly without the interpreter. I
didn't snoop on the USB traffic. I do think that it's unlikely, especially since my previous post
showed VueScan is no sharper than just using the SANE API.
