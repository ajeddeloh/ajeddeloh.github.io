	<h4> Background </h4>

<p>As part of another project, I needed to make my own inductors in the 100-1000uH range. I
originally wrote a <a href=https://github.com/ajeddeloh/lrc>python script</a> to control my
oscilloscope and function generator to measure them, but I ultimately wanted something standalone
where I could just plug in an inductor. I had my <a
href=https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/32l476gdiscovery.html> STM32L476G-Discovery development
board</a> left over from a class in college so I decided to use that.</p>

	<h4> Theory </h4>

<p>The project is pretty simple in theory: apply a sine wave to a resistor and the inductor under
test in series and measure the total voltage across both and the voltage across just the
inductor.</p>

<img src=simplified-circuit.png>

<p>The ratio of complex voltages can then be used to determine the impedance which can be used to
determine the inductance. </p>

<br> <img src=equations.png>

<p>In order to accurately measure the amplitude of the sine waves, as well as to reduce noise, I use
a discrete Fourier transform at the frequency of the applied sine wave. This has a few advantages:
</p>

<ul>

<li> The DFT returns complex numbers to represent the amplitude and phase. The above equation uses
complex numbers for the voltages already. </li>

<li> Capturing more cycles increases precision. By varying the capture length I can tune precision
vs speed. </li>

<li> It rejects noise at all other frequencies, excepts those that might be aliased to the frequency
being measured. </li>

</ul>

Normally there's a gotchas with using DFTs, but I carefully avoid them: 

<ul>

<li> The DFT assumes the data is cyclic. If it is not, it will contain discontinuities between the
last element and the first element, which will appear as high frequency harmonics. Normally this is
solved via multiplying the data with a windowing function, but in this case I can simply ensure the
data is cyclic by capturing an integer number of waves. Since the ADC and DAC use the same clock I
also don't need to worry about clock skew between them either. </li>

<li> The runtime complexity of a DFT is O(n log n) and would need to operate on an array of already
collected data. However, since I only care about one frequency, I only need to compute it at one
frequency. Computing the DFT at a single frequency is just O(n), uses O(1) space and can be computed
as I receive data (assuming each sample can be processed before the next sample arrives). </li>

</ul>

<p>Aliasing is another potential problem, which I have ignored entirely. Frequencies above 666kHz
will alias. In the future I may add antialiasing filters. See the <a
href=#improvements>improvements</a> section below. In practice however, aliasing does not appear to
be a significant source of error.</p>

<h4> Implementation </h4>

<p>The implementation is pretty straightforward: generate a sine wave at a bunch of different
frequencies, measure the impedance at each frequency, then use linear regression to find the slope,
which will be the inductance.</p>

<p>There are two tricky parts:</p>

<h5> Generating sines </h5>

<p> The sine wave generation is <b>mostly</b> straightforward. The DAC is set up to use DMA to load
each sample from a sine lookup table. A timer triggers each load. </p>

<p> The tricky part is changing frequencies. For the frequency to change, the DMA buffer length must
be changed to represent the new period and the data in the buffer must be changed. However, the
STM32L476G does not support changing the DMA buffer length while the DMA channel is active. This
mean it needs to be changed between samples. The new data also needs to be copied in to the buffer
but only after the DMA has already the data being overwritten. </p>

<p>Luckily, there are two status flags in the DMA interrupt status register that indicate when the
transfer is half done and completely done. After it is half complete we can copy the first half of
the new data in. After it is 100% complete we can change the length (between the last sample and the
first sample) and copy the second half.</p>

<p>Normally interrupts would be great for this. However, there is at least 12 cycles of latency
between when the flag is set and when the interrupt is executed. Since changing the DMA buffer
length needs to be done in under 15 cycles, doing it in the interrupt is out of the question.</p>

<p>Instead of using interrupts, I poll the status bits. I use inline assembly so I can load all of
the constants I need into registers before starting the polling loop, ensuring it switches the
length as quickly as possible once the bit gets flipped. See <code>src/dac.c</code> for the
details.</p>

<pre><code>
__asm volatile(
        // wait for the DAC to read the last element
        "loop%=:\n" // wait for the TC flag
        "       ldr     r0, [%[rTCIF]]\n"
        "       cmp     r0, #1\n"
        "       bne     loop%=\n"
        // turn off DMA, Use %[DMAen] as a 0 since only the LSB matter when bit-banding
        // and since all BB'd addressed are word aligned it's always 0;
        "       str     %[rDMAen], [%[rDMAen]]\n"
        "       str     %[rLen], [%[rDMAlen]]\n"
        "       str     r0, [%[rDMAen]]\n"
                : // no outputs, so the volatile keyword is redundant
                : [rTCIF]"l"(&BB(DMA2->ISR)[DMA_ISR_TCIF5_Pos]), // tcif5 flag bit
                        [rDMAen]"l"(&BB(DMA2_Channel5->CCR)[DMA_CCR_EN_Pos]), // dma en bit
                        [rLen] "l" (sine->len), // new len to load
                        [rDMAlen] "l" (&DMA2_Channel5->CNDTR) // address to but new len in
                : "cc", "r0"
        );

</code></pre>

<h5> Calculating the DFT </h5>

<p>As mentioned before, since we only need to calculate the DFT at one frequency we can calculate it
on the fly, as long as we do it fast enough. Static variables keep track of the real and imaginary
sums for total and inductor. When the ADC starts, it zeros them and the IRQ handler computes the sum
every waveform, adding to them. I originally had <i>terrible</i> performance until I realized that
since the sums were marked <code>volatile</code> (because the IRQ handler modifies them), the code
in the IRQ handler itself was writing the sum back to memory every time it modified them instead of
keeping them in registers. This is especially painful since the sums are <code>int64_t</code> and
need to load or store both registers. 

<h4> Electronics </h4>

<p> <img src=full-schematic.png> </p>

<p>The electronics are pretty simple. It's just an op amp buffering the DAC output and the ADC
inputs. One of the op amps is used as a virtual ground. I used an <code>LM324</code> op amp because
it's what I had on hand, but it's really a poor choice given how prone it is to crossover
distortion. I had to add resistors to (real, non-virtual) ground to prevent it from badly
distorting. It also has an <i>abymsal</i> slew rate of 0.5V/us which can slew limit it even at low
(100kHz) frequencies. Finally, its output can't get closer than ~0.5V from ground when sourcing a
few milliamps of current. A much better op amp choice would be a <code>MCP6294</code>.

<h4> Results </h4>

I'm pretty pleased with the results. Readings are consistent both with itself and with the original
oscilloscope and function generator based version. I can get ~2uH of resolution when measuring a
1080uH inductor, which is pretty good.

<h4> Improvements </h4>

<p>The biggest improvement would be adding gain to op amp measuring the voltage over the inductor.
Currently the voltage is quite low, even with a large (1080uH) inductor and most of the ADC
resolution is wasted. A digipot could be used to set the gain, though increasing the gain would
certainly call for a better op amp. </p> 

<p>I'd also like to run the ADC at a faster sample rate, which would require the
