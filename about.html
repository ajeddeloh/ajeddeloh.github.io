	<h4> About Me </h4>
I'm Andrew Jeddeloh and this is my project log. In case it's not apparent from this website, I'm
not very interested in web design. I'm a fan of <a href=https://simplifier.neocities.org>simplifier
</a> and loosely modeled this site off of it. The name comes from when I typo'd my last name on an
assignment and decided that would be a good name for a blog.
<br>
<br>
I'm currently looking for a job. If you're looking for an embedded engineer in San Fransisco or the
East Bay, send me an email.
